In game development, a **singleton** is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This can be particularly useful for managing game states, configurations, or resources that need to be accessed from various parts of the game.

In **Godot Engine**, singletons are often referred to as **autoloads**. Here's how you can create and use a singleton in Godot:

1. **Create a Script**: Write a script that will act as your singleton. For example, you might create a script called `Global.gd` to manage game states.
    
    ```gdscript
    extends Node
    
    var score = 0
    
    func increase_score(points):
        score += points
    ```
    
2. **Set Up Autoload**: To make this script a singleton, go to **Project > Project Settings > Autoload**. Add your script (`Global.gd`) and give it a name (e.g., `Global`). This will make the script globally accessible.
    
3. **Access Singleton**: You can now access the singleton from any other script in your project using the name you assigned. For example:
    
    ```gdscript
    func _on_Player_scored(points):
        Global.increase_score(points)
    ```
    

By using `Global.gd` as your singleton, you can easily manage and access shared data or functionality across different scenes and scripts in your game. This can help keep your code organized and reduce dependencies between different parts of your project.
